title: "Photography Site"
paragraph_1: "This site was made in the first two weeks of the DevelopMe bootcamp. It was produced in HTML and CSS based on a provided design. The site is responsive to changes in screen size. I produced the site prior to learning Git. Therefore, the git repository was initialised after project completion, and there are therefore few commits."
