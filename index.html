        <p>I am a web developer, working in a full-stack role since August 2020. I am a driven and conscientious individual, with a keen eye for detail. I love using my logic skills to solve programming problems, and I am persistent when faced with challenging questions. I also have an affinity with data, having previously worked as a data analyst for several years.
        </p>
        <p>My commercial experience has primarily been in Ruby on Rails applications on sites used by not-for-profit providers and local authorities, and a large e-commerce application. Whilst working with Ruby on Rails I regularly use the Mintiest suite both in TDD and to test code changes. I also use Vue.js, and have integrated this with Ruby on Rails applications. I also have experience of jQuery and Angular in a commercial setting.
        </p>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy hiking, with the Lake District and the Alps as personal favourite spots. I am also a huge fan of watching live sport, especially football and cricket.
