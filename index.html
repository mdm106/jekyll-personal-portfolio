        <p>I am an experienced software engineer, having worked commercially since 2020. I am a driven and conscientious individual, with a keen eye for detail. I love using my logic skills to solve programming problems, and I am persistent when faced with challenging questions.
        </p>
        <p>I have primarily worked as a Ruby on Rails developer, and in my current role I work on a Rails 8 monolith with a web interface and API for integration with a Flutter mobile app. This uses modern Rails features including Hotwire with Turbo Streams, Websockets with Action Cable and Stimulus.js.</p>
        <p>In my current role I have been responsible for several key features of the app. For example I produced a complete survey system for creating, completing and reporting surveys. I also implemented an integration with the APIs for two different external ticketing systems (Zendesk and Freshdesk) so that help and support requests made through the app are directed to the relevant help desk. I also wrote an integration with an external shift system to allow users to view and book shifts.</p>
        <p>Although mainly a Ruby developer, I am also proficient with Javascript, having used Vue.js in my previous role, and currently Stimulus.js in the Rails 8 app.</p>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy hiking, with the Lake District and the Alps as personal favourite spots. I also enjoy playing tennis and I am a huge fan of watching live sport, especially football and cricket.</p>
